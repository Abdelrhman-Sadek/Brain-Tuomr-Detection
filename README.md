in these model I used to machine learning techniques the frist one is svm we used svc because of the shorteness in the data 
and the seacond one we made a CNN model that should preform better with images than svm but it takes more time but give more accuracy
the svm model acc is :82%
the CNN model acc is : 89% and can be more if we increase the epochs 
the data fill in rar is attached with the model
